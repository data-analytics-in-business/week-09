    "# 01 - Generating random data in Python\n",
    "This week we are going to learn how to perform cluster analysis in Python. But before that, let's generate some random data in Python, and learn some Python along the way! After that, we will perform cluster analysis on the random data to better understand how cluster analysis works and its limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should I care about generating random data?\n",
    "Great question! We all want to perform analysis on *real* data to solve *real* problems, but when we perform analysis we always need to be aware of the limitations of the analysis method we are using and the risks of generalising or taking actions based on the results. This is where \"random\" or \"toy\" data can be useful. Firstly, it enables us to generate some data for which we have a good understanding of the process generating the data, and this enables us to evaluate an analysis method based on how well it models the underlying process. Secondly, we can easily tweak and change the toy data to become a dataset where the analysis method fails, and this enables us to easily compare the strengths and weaknesses of different analysis methods. Thirdly, it is just a good way to learn and to understand how an analysis method works for a very simple dataset and problem, and this provides us with a strong foundation of understanding to start exploring and developing models for more complex datasets and problems.\n",
